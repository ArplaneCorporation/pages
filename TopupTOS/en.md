# Recharge requirements
- Top-up is divided into 2 types as follows:
   - [Type 1 Internal Payment Gateway](#section-1)
   - [Type 2 External Payment Gateway](#section-2)
---
## Section 1
- Internal Payment Gateway or IPG will not charge a fee per time of transfer because it is an internal payment system, which has TrueMoney PromptPay in this section.
- If a transfer is made but the memo with the Discord account ID or server ID number is not specified, it will not be possible to top up.
- If you specify a penny, it will be included in the balance. For example, adding 1000.90 baht will make the top-up amount 100090 coins.
- You will not be able to top up if that ID is not found in the system.
## Section 2
- External Payment Gateway or EPG will collect fees as per the table below:
